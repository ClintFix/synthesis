                    Match quality, the term economists use for the degree of fit between an individual&apos;s abilities and interests and the work they do, is something for which I&apos;ve been searching since high school. The search hasn&apos;t been without its twists, turns, and upsets, but without the journey I wouldn&apos;t be where I am today: with breadth of experience and finally a career that feels like a perfect match.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Though my career began as a Mechanical Engineer, a recurring pattern emerged in my early career: I kept getting distracted by various problems that could be solved with software. My interests obviously laid outside of mechanical engineering. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In late 2020, while sitting in my home office feeling a bit too sorry for myself as I scrolled Twitter, I came across a tweet by Austen Allred, the founder of Lambda School. I had been following Lambda for some time — both because I love the alternative education space and because I love the startup world and follow many YC companies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There was nothing particulary special with the tweet. It was just another tweet showing off the results of a Lambda grad. But this time the tweet hit me hard. The local small business I had started a couple years prior to keep food on the table after parting ways with a company I had co-founded was hurting...bad. The shutdowns all but decimated it. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I couldn&apos;t stand the thought of going back into mechanical engineering. I wasn&apos;t in a spot to start another company. And the tinge of regret for having not learned software development was growing with every passing year. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So I lept. I dove into Lambda School&apos;s full-stack web development program in January of 2021. In the last 5 months I&apos;ve learned Javascript, React, Redux, Node/Express, SQL, PostgreSQL, and Python. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I was hungry for more so I started a side-project around one of the many ideas I&apos;ve come up with over the years: PodChat. It&apos;s not live yet, but you can follow the progress at <a href="http://PodChatApp.com" alt="PodChat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PodChatApp.com</a> and view the project on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/pod-chat" alt="PodChat Github" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PodChat Github</a>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Looking forward, <span style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>I have one primary goal: becoming a valuable engineering team member with Synthesis.</span> I built this site using Next.js to learn the framework and show that I have the ability to learn quickly.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But success goes beyond mere skills and ability. A loyal teammate requires match quality — a teammate that is also immensely interested in the company&apos;s mission.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since long before I had kids, I envisioned taking them through a different educational system —
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    One that would teach them <span style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>how to think</span> rather than what to think. 
                    <br />
                    One that would inspire them to grow and learn. 
                    <br />
                    One that fostered their creativity. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Synthesis would be far more than just a job at a hot startup. It&apos;s building something important that I&apos;ve cared about and have been seeking for my own family. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I can&apos;t wait to contribute to the mission.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Cheers!
                    <br />
