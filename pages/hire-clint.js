                    But for real, I&apos;m excited that you took the time to check out my simple Next.js app. I built it to practice the framework and toy around with getServerSideProps. Overall, the framework seems fairly simple to grasp. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I noticed a few things: 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It would have made more sense to ISR for the Tweet data fetching (getStaticProps with the revalidate property). There&apos;s not much of a need to fetch Chrisman&apos;s tweets on every refresh. Every hour or even just once a day may have been a better choice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I&apos;m excited to learn and try out more advanced features and learn exactly how Synthesis is using Next.js for their internal tooling and with Portal.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I&apos;m  looking forward to the next steps!
